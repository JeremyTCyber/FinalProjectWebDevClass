    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My Name is Jeremy Townsend, I am a musician at heart. I love to sing and I hope to use my love for singing to support me
	and my family. I was a music major for 3 years at ENMU, after some events transpired I decided to move here to Las Cruces with my parents and try to find a job.
	I landed a job at a call center, after 2 weeks I already hated that job.I decided I should come up with a plan to keep myself fed as I try to pursue becoming a professional musician.
	I ended up in IT because I thought it would be a good fit and have the best opportunities for me to do remote work.
	Ultimatly I want to sing around the world with some of the best professional choirs in the world.</p>
