<h2>Things that I think need to be considered in a mid-sized organization when considering back end technologies are;

<br><br>Current needs: Think of what the website need to function properly and efficiently at this moment.

<br><br>Scalability: This is extremely important to think about. Don't only think about how the website works currently, think about the future needs of the website.

<br><br>Security: Security could be considered the most important think to consider when it comes to back end technologies. Find ones the meet any specific security requirements of your company.

<br><br>Cost: Cost can be the biggest determining factor in this decision. 

<br><br>Something could be perfect for you company but is just way outside of budget so it is important to have multiple options at different price ranges.
Maintenance/support: This can be important when working with other companies to provide a service, when things break it is good to know how much support you will get from the vendor. 
Also it is important to consider how much time and effort will need to be devoted by your team to maintain the service.</h2>
